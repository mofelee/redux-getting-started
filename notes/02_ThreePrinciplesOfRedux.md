###### Three Principles of Redux
1. **Represent the whole state of your application as a single javascript object.** All mutations and changes to the state in Redux are explicit, so it's possible to keep track of them. *Everything that changes in your application, including the data and the UI state, is contained in a single object that we call the state or the state tree.*
2. **The state tree is READ ONLY - you cannot modify or write to it.** Anytime you want to change the state, you need to *dispatch* an *action*. An action is a plain javascript object describing the change. Just like the state is the minimal representation of the data in your app, the action is the minimal representation of the change to that data. Any data that gets into a redux application gets there via actions.
3. **To describe state mutations, you have to write a function that takes the previous state of the app and the action being dispatched, and returns the next state of the app.** This function is called the *reducer*, and **MUST BE PURE**.
